# JavaScript Challenge
Due 8/27/2020.

## Level 1: Search by Date
To view the Level 1 portion of the assignment, please navigate to the `UFO-level-1` directory and open `index.html`.

I used the provided HTML and CSS templates, with a few notable changes:
* I decided to use more specific placeholder instructions for searching for a date in the aside, since the dates of the provided data were limited to two weeks in January 2010.
* Because the instructions in the previous step were longer, I made the aside span the full width of the webpage on top of the table, rather than having it in a small box to the left.
* I made the filter button a bit more visually appealing (to me, at least).

## Level 2: Search by Multiple Categories
To view the Level 2 portion of the assignment, please navigate to the `UFO-level-2` directory and open `index.html`.

Here, I continued to build off of the previous page. The following are the further additions made:
* I changed the Bootswatch theme to a more updated version, since the provided theme gave me some issues with the dropdown menu I wanted to incorporate.
* I added a "reset filter" button to repopulate the full data upon clicking.
* I also added a dropdown menu with a list of each searchable category. Upon clicking each item, the placeholder text will change to fitting instructions. The input box will also be cleared.
* The table can now also be filtered by each of the categories in the dropdown menu. You can actually search for "country" even if you selected "date" in the dropdown menu, which I may tinker with at a later time.
* Various minor styling changes were made as well.
